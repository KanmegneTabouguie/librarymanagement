Library Management System
This project is a simple Library Management System built with React for the front end and Node.js with Express and MongoDB for the back end. It allows users to view a list of books, add new books, update book information, delete books, and publish/unpublish books.

Project Structure
Frontend
src/components/BookList.js
This component displays a list of books retrieved from the backend. It utilizes React for the UI and Axios for handling HTTP requests. The component includes the following features:

Fetching Book Data: On component mount, it makes a GET request to the backend API endpoint (http://localhost:3017/books) to retrieve the list of books and updates the component state with the fetched data.

Deleting a Book: Users can delete a book by clicking the "Delete" button. This action triggers a DELETE request to the backend API to remove the book from the database. The component then updates its state to reflect the deletion.

Displaying Book Information: Each book is displayed with its title, author, and availability status. The availability status is dynamically shown as either "Available" or "Not Available."

Navigation Links: Users can navigate to other parts of the application using the provided links:

"Add Book": Navigates to the page where users can add a new book.
"Update": Navigates to the page where users can update the details of a specific book.
"Publish": Navigates to the page where users can toggle the availability status of a specific book.
Random Color Styling: Each book entry is styled with a random background color generated by the getRandomColor function.

src/components/AddBook.js
This component allows users to add a new book to the library. Users can input the title and author of the book, and the component communicates with the backend to add the book. A modal is displayed with a confirmation message after adding a book.

src/components/PublishBook.jsx
This component handles the publishing and unpublishing of books. It retrieves the book's current availability status from the backend and provides a button to toggle the availability. Users can navigate back to the book list from this page.

src/components/UpdateBook.jsx
This component allows users to update the information of an existing book. It retrieves the current details of the book from the backend, allows users to input new information, and updates the book on the server.

Backend
app.js
This file sets up the Express server, connects to the MongoDB database, and defines routes for handling book-related operations.

routes/bookRoutes.js
This module defines the routes for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books. It includes methods for retrieving all books, getting a single book, adding a new book, updating book information, and deleting a book.
